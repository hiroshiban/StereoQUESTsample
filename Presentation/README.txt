[about this experiment]

Oblique3D_QUEST, oblique3d_display.m, and oblique3d_stimulus_{main1|main2|XY1|XY2|Z1|Z2}.m
- Slanted planes are presented.
- The gradient angles are one of -52.5, -37.5, -22.5, -7.5, 7.5, 22.5, 37.5, 52.5 degs (slanted from the horizontal line).
- 2-AFC, a QUEST method, 60 trials for each of the conditions
- feedback (correct/incorrect) is presented after each trial, if requested
- task: discriminating which stimulus (the first or the second) is tilted more to horizontal
- threshold: 0.82 correct (0.82 is equivalent to a 3 up 1 down standard staircase)
- Each run will take about 15 mins.
- Totally, 8 conditions x 4 orientations (0, 45, 90, 135 deg rotation) x 3 repetitions
- The whole session can be completed around 270 mins
